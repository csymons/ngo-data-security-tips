# ngo-data-security-tips

A list of tips for NGOs to keep their data _secure_.

Types of attack of most concern to NGOs:

## An attacker wandering in and taking the computer or device

To plan for this:
* Make sure all machines and devices have a secure login.
* Encrypt all hard drives and backups.
* Keep any sensitive data in the "cloud" and don't have a local copy.
* Keep phones and devices encrypted.
* Enable devices to be wiped remotely.
* Use end-to-end encrypted chats whose history automatically clears.

## An attacker obtaining access to a team member's account

To plan for this:
* Avoid group chats when discussing anything private.
* Use end-to-end encrypted chats whose history automatically clears.

## A man-in-the-middle attack

This is where an attacker gets between you and a service (like gmail) or
between you and another user (in the case of a chat app).

To plan for this:
* Always use HTTPS URLs in your browser (as opposed to HTTP; look for the
  lock icon in the location bar) and do not ignore certificate warnings.
* Use end-to-end encrypted chats whose history automatically clears.

## A straight-out NGO hack (Chinese hackers have been known to target NGOs)

* Always use 2-factor authentication for online services (e.g. gmail,
  Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Windows 10, Telegram, Apple accounts and most
  other services).
* Never use the same password twice. Use a password manager to generate
  passwords, never make one up.

## A hack of a public service like Facebook and hackers gaining a large batch of emails and passwords

* Always use 2-factor authentication for online services (e.g. gmail,
  Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Windows 10, Telegram, Apple accounts and most
  other services)
* Never use the same password twice. Use a password manager to generate
  passwords, never make one up.

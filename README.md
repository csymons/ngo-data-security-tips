# ngo-data-security-tips
A list of tips for NGOs to keep their data _secure_.

Types of attack of most concern to NGOs:

## Attacker wondering in and taking the computer or device.

To plan for:
* Make sure all machines and devices have a secure login.
* Encrypt all hard drives and backups.
* Keep any sensitive data in the "cloud" and not have a local copy.
* Keep phones and devices encrypted.
* Enable devices to be wiped remote.
* Use end to end encrypted chats those history automatically clears.

## An attacker obtaining a member of the team's account

To plan for:
* Avoid group chats when discussing anything private.
* Use end to end encrypted chats those history automatically clears.

## A man-in-the-middle attack
This is where an attacker gets between you and a service (like gmail) or between you and another user (in the case of a chat app)

To plan for:
* Always use the HTTPS for URLs in your browser (as opposed to HTTP) and do not ignore certificate warnings.
* Use end to end encrypted chats those history automatically clears.

## A straight out NGO hack (Chinese hackers have been known to target NGOs)
* Always use 2-step authentication for online services. (like gmail, facebook, twitter, slack, windows 10, telegram, apple accounts and most other services)
* Never use the same password twice. Use a password manager.

## A hack of a public service like facebook and hackers gaining a large batch of emails and passwords
* Always use 2-step authentication for online services. (like gmail, facebook, twitter, slack, windows 10, telegram, apple accounts and most other services)
* Never use the same password twice. Use a password manager.
